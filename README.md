This project is part of the Odin Project JavaScript track curriculum. Todo lists are a staple in beginning webdev tutorials because they can be very simple. There is, however, a lot of room for improvement and many features that can be added. The goal of this project is to show SOLID coding principle by separating the applications logic into separate module.
